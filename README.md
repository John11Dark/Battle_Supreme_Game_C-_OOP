# Battle Supreme Game

You have been asked to implement another game, Battle Supreme, as a Windows Form Application. You are required to use the Object-Oriented and Event-Driven approach and use different functions and methods to organize the required game functionality.  
This game is a single player game where the player needs to choose a character and battle against another randomly generated character.
You need to manage the health and player points until characters do not have any health left.
For this game you will need to manage the events for the GUI interface as well as the OOP structure which is related to the game play. Our company’s UI designers have provided you with a readily available GUI using a Windows Form application. This form is populated with Tabs, panels, and various other UI elements to handle the user’s input in relation to populating the game characters as well as the simple game play.
